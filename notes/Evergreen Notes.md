Evergreen notes are a concept originating from [[@Andy Matuschak]]. These are notes that have been reviewed and refined enough to ignore until they're organically brought up in a new context later.

Ideally, you’d review your new notes within 1-2 days, refactor them, and then change the status to “Evergreen” 🌲 (don't overthink this).

# Key Concepts for Evergreen Notes
- [[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]
- [[Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies]]
- [[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding the audience]]

Largely builds upon [[@Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Zettelkasten]].
