Syncing notes across devices is enabled through a paid service from [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md/). At the time of this writing, itâ€™s $10/mo and from my experience, is very seamless and fast.

My devices: **iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad Air 4th Gen, MacBook Pro 16"**

See [this page](https://obsidian.md/sync) for more details on signing up/enabling.

Note that settings automatically sync across devices in the `.obsidian` directory, and mobile-specific settings are synced in the `.mobile` directory. Changes are nearly instantaneous.
