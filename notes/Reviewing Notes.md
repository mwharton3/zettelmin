To review raw notes after they have been collected throughout the day:
1. Go to the [[Notes Inbox]] page (this is linked from the [[Daily Notes Page]])
2. For 🌱 notes:
	- change the ❓ status to a note type emoji from [[Status Reference]]
	- refine, refactor, and create at least one link using the \[\[Note Name\]\] syntax (following [[Zettelkasten Principles]])
		- Creating dead links of important concepts is okay and encouraged, you can always create the link content later
	- change the status to either 🌲 (reviewed, will do this most of the time) or 🌞 (still ruminating/refining)
3. For 🌞 notes, refine over time and work toward either converting to 🌲 or refactoring parts of your notes to new 🌲 notes

❗**IMPORTANT**: *This system doesn’t use `#`-style tags for anything other than status/note type. Use `[[<content>]]`-style links for everything else. See [[Folders vs. Tags vs. Links]] for more detail.

Once notes reach 🌲status, you can relax and forget about them until they come up in context again later.

See [[Evergreen Notes]] for more information on the 🌲 status.
