 In general, when a person sits down to create a note-taking system (using [[Evernote]], [[OneNote]], or the like), they will: 
- Invent a folder structure (e.g. `/Meetings`, `/Quick Notes`, `/Grocery Lists`, â€¦)
- Bear the cognitive load of categorizing when they create notes
  - This disincentivizes them to take notes in the first place
- Find out later that they got the structure wrong and have to reorganize everything (or give up on using the system)

This may not be true for everyone, but it certainly is for many.
