Some core principles of [[Zettelkasten]]:
1. **Atomicity**: Coined by [Christian Tietze](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/). Each note should contain one idea and one idea only.
2. **Autonomy**: Each note should be autonomous, i.e. self-contained and comprehensible on its own (doesn't require anything external).
3. **Always link** whenever a new note is added, link to existing notes. Avoid dangling links. 
4. **Explain links**: Whenever notes are connected, explain with some context. Years later you won't remember why a link was created.
5. **Use your own words**: Don't copy/paste.
6. **Keep references**: Always add references to your notes so that you know where an idea came from. Prevents plagiarism.
7. **Add your own thoughts**: Random musings are important
8. **Don't worry about structure**: There are no "privileged positions".
9. **Add connection notes**: As you begin to see connections, create notes about why links were created.
10. **Add outline notes**: As ideas coalesce to themes, add outline notes.
11. **Never delete**: Don't delete anything
12. **[[Add notes without fear]]**: You'll never have too much information. 

I also follow one additional rule:
- [[Respect natural hierarchies when linking notes]]
