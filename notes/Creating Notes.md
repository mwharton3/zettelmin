To create a new note:
1. Create a new note, ensuring to [[Add notes without fear|add notes without fear]]
	- The **”Hotkeys for Templates”** community plugin automatically loads the default note template if configured correctly.
	- Don't add directories, all of your notes should auto-populate into `notes/`, which should remain flat.
2. Write something unfiltered without holding back (use `Ctrl/Cmd + E` to swap between edit/preview modes)

See [[Markdown Reference]] for some ideas on basic markdown formatting.
