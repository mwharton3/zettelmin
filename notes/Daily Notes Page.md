The Daily Notes Page is meant to be a home page for notetaking, especially on your desktop computer. It builds on top of the **Daily Notes** core plugin and **Calendar** community plugin.

# Accessing
Click the daily notes icon on the left toolbar (it looks like a calendar ðŸ“†)

# Usage
- If you click the journal entry link at the top, a daily journal entry will be created for you to write in.
- The [[Notes Inbox]] page is linked at the top, which you can use as a tool when [[Reviewing Notes|reviewing notes]]
- Tasks are entered using the **Tasks** community plugin. See [[Obsidian Tasks Reference]].
	- You can add a task on *any* page using `- [ ] #task <task description>` and it will show up on your daily page.
# Customizing
Add quick links to the top if there are pages that you frequent a lot.
