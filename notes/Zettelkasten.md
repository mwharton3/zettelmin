Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a [[bottom-up approach]] to notetaking, where hierarchies form naturally over time. This is much preferable to [[how we naturally take notes]].


There are several categories for notes in the original system:
- **Permanent notes** - the organized/linked stuff
- **Fleeting notes** - quick ideas, thoughts, and things of interest
- **Literature notes (books)** - taken from reading and captures thoughts sparked from the text

Each note gets its own notecard. The notes don't get auto-categorized, they're self-forming.

There are many [[Zettelkasten Principles]] that should be followed. Obviously, this system needs to be adapted to the modern age, but for the most part it has stood the test of time and is a very generic and powerful approach.
