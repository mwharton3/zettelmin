Each note will have a status (in the form of a \#-style tag) at the bottom indicating the type of the note. New notes will default to **\#🌱/❓**.

These status codes only use emojis and are of the form:
**\#\<status\>/\<note_type\>**

🟢 **TIP**: The Emoji Shortcodes community plugin allows you to type “:” and easily navigate emojis, much like Slack.
