Tag chaining is a strategy to add tags between notes (as you go) where one or more mid-tier tags are added between the root and parent tag.

Consider a note titled **”Temperament of Border Collies”**. It would be very tempting to tag with **”dogs”**.

However, this results in a flat list of references to **”dogs”** over time and artificially promotes a really broad topic, in addition to making searching harder.

A better way to link would be:
**“Temperament of Border Collies” ▶ “Border Collies” (new empty note) ▶ “dogs”**

Now, the **“dogs”** node has fewer, more pertinent links as you develop notes on border collies, and more importantly you can take notes without the fear of over-generalizing links.

❗**CAUTION** If you don’t do this as you go and only use mid-tier tags, it’s likely you’ll end up with orphans (i.e. you might have a collection of notes with tags **“Border Collies”**, **“German Shepherds”**, etc. that don’t link to **“dogs”**).
